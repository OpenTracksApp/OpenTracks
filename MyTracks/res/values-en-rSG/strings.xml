    sensor in your phone to record the path you have taken. It will also gather useful statistics such as
    time, speed, distance and elevation. You can review all of this data live, or you can save it
    for use later. While you\'re out, you can mark relevant way points and can ask to hear automatic
    voice announcements about your progress.\n
    \n
    My Tracks can record data from external sensors:\n
    - Zephyr Technology Consumer HxM Bluetooth heart rate monitor\n
    - Polar Bluetooth heart rate monitor\n
    - ANT+ heart rate monitors (*)\n
    - SRM power meters, speed and cadence sensors (*)\n
    - More sensor support coming soon\n
    \n
    * ANT+ and SRM support requires an ANT+ compatible phone\n
    \n
    My Tracks can share your track data:\n
    - As a GPX, KML, CSV, or TCX file\n
    - Using Google Maps, Google Fusion Tables or Google Docs\n
    - Via Google+, Facebook or Twitter\n
    \n
    Other features:\n
    - Record in Metric or Imperial units (configured from the Recording menu, under Settings)\n
    - Display your movement in terms of Speed or Pace (configured from the Display menu, under
    Settings)\n
