    The GPS receiver draws a relatively high amount of power, so a fully charged battery typically
    survives less than 5 hours. Battery life depends on many factors, including signal strength,
    battery freshness, and tasks running in parallel. Switching off some or all of the phone\'s
    radios will lengthen battery life. Putting the phone into Airplane mode will yield the best
    results.

    GPS receivers measure elevations much less precisely than latitude and longitude. Elevations
    can sometimes be off by a few hundred feet, though relative changes are tracked more precisely.
    To get a good elevation measurement, make sure that you have a strong GPS signal and wait a few
    minutes for the elevation to settle to a stable value.

    For My Tracks to work, your phone needs to be in line-of-sight contact with the GPS satellites.
    If the line-of-sight is obstructed by trees, buildings or canyon walls, you may not get an
    accurate fix. If you see the message, wait a minute or two. If your device does not achieve a
    fix, move to an area clear of obstructions and try again.

    Under optimal conditions, the location error can be +/- 20 feet (6 meters). However, precision
    depends on the quality of the GPS signal. The blue circle around the orange location arrow
    indicates estimated precision. (You may need to zoom in or out to see the circle.) You can
    change the GPS precision at Settings -> Recording -> GPS accuracy. If the precision is too low,
    at the top of the screen, you will see the message \"Waiting for a better GPS fix.\".
