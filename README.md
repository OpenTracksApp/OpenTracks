## Project history

_OpenTracks_ is based upon Google _My Tracks app_ ([code](https://code.google.com/archive/p/mytracks/)).
Initially, _My Tracks_ was initially released by Google in 2010 as [open-source software](http://google-latlong.blogspot.fr/2010/05/code-for-my-tracks-is-now-yours.html).
In 2016, [Google decided to discontinue](https://support.google.com/maps/answer/6333516) _My Tracks_ and stopped distributing it via the Google Play store in April 2016.
The [Plonk42](https://github.com/plonk42) conducted some maintenance work until 2016, so _My Tracks_ could still be used (based upon version _Google's MyTracks_ version 2.0.6).
Plonk42's version is available [here](https://github.com/Plonk42/mytracks).
In 2019, _OpenTracks_ was forked from Plonk42's _My Tracks_ and major rework was conducted.

Rework of _OpenTracks_ included:
* removing Google's analytics code, 
* removing integration into Google Drive, 
* removing Google Maps integration,
* removing Google Earth integration,
* removing use of Google Play service,
* removing calorie estimation and activity estimation,
* removing support for ANT+ and Classic Bluetooth,
* adding support for Bluetooth LE heart rate sensors,
* removing Protobuf (store sensor data in SQLite columns directly), and
* removing Android Service API for other apps.

Artwork, logos and user interface remained more or less unchanged.
